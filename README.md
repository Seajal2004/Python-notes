# Python Notes Repository

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seajal Gupta

Welcome to my personal collection of Python notes and exercises. Whether you're just starting your Python journey or looking for quick references, I hope this repository can be a helpful resource for you!

## Why I Created This Repository
As someone passionate about coding and learning, I believe in organizing and sharing knowledge to help others grow. These notes were created while I explored Python programming, aiming to cover essential concepts in a structured and easy-to-understand way.

## What's Inside?
This repository contains well-structured Jupyter notebooks, including:

- **Variables, Data Types, Numbers, and Strings**: Basics to get you started with Python.
- **Operators**: Understanding mathematical and logical operations.
- **List, Tuple, and Set**: Working with Python's versatile data structures.
- **Dictionaries**: Managing key-value pairs effectively.
- **Arrays**: For numerical computations and operations.
- **Conditional Statements (If...else)**: Writing decision-making code.
- **Loops**: Automating repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**: Modular and reusable code.
- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding advanced programming concepts.
- **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression**: Understanding regression models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implementing classification models.

- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Exploring instance-based learning.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implementing clustering techniques.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Understanding another clustering approach.
- **Streamlit Application**: A small project to showcase Streamlit's simplicity for web apps.
- **DTRF_compressed.pdf**: A document on Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- **LinearandLogistic.pdf**: A document covering both linear and logistic regression.
- **Clustering.pdf & Clustering (1).pdf**: Comprehensive notes on clustering methods.
- **DATASETS.zip**: A collection of datasets used for exercises and projects.
